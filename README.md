# Application of PCA for Color Images

This repository is for DA623: Computing with Signals course project. It contains code demonstrating the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for compressing and analyzing colored images.

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in image processing. It aims to reduce the complexity of image data while retaining important visual information. In this project, we apply PCA to colored images to explore its effectiveness in compression and visualization.
